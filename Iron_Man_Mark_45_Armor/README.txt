# Summary

*UPDATE* I have deleted all "FIXED" files, due to complications with the "Makeprintable"  program adding in a solid piece at random locations. The original, UNFIXED files have been loaded. Hopefully this will alleviate any further complications. Any fixes will have to be done as the user sees necessary. 

*UPDATE* I have closed out the files, and is no longer a "Work in Progress". I will still try to answer any questions that anyone has.

*UPDATE* ALL PARTS HAVE BEEN UPLOADED FOR THE SUIT. PLEASE POST ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT IT, AND I WILL DO MY BEST TO ANSWER THEM.

You may share these files, but not sell them for a profit. Some files need to be sliced to fit your printbed. Mine is scaled to 1.2, (this is because I am 6'5", so know you know why.). This is the Mark 45 armor from Age of Ultron. Files will be added, as they are finished.

*UPDATE* From here on out, all files will need to be sliced. It is taking too long for me to slice each one, with no guarantee that it will fit other printers. So, you will have to slice the files to fit your printer. I have uploaded only the left arm. You will have to mirror the file in order to make the right arm. 

Part 1: Helmet 
Part 2: Neck *Works better if this part is printed in Ninjaflex, otherwise it is very hard to turn your head.*
Part 3: Neck Collar
Part 4: Shoulder Pad
Part 5: Shoulder
Part 6: Bicep
Part 7: Forearm
Part 8: Palm - *Stand on end with the opening for the fingers facing up*
Part 9: Fingers - *Works best if you separate the parts and print vertically. This keeps the support material to just the finger tips.*
Part 10: Back Plate - *With some patience, it can be either sliced or modified after printing for functional flaps.*
