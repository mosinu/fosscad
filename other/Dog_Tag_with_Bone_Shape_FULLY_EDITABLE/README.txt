# Summary

I love my dog and I would never want lose him. That's why I designed this bone-shaped dog tag that you can edit with your mate's name and some info to contact you in case of any breakaway. You can also leave it clean and attach it to your buddy's collar and make him look cooler!

To edit it you can use the .f3d file

Please post your "make" after printing it, and comments are highly appreciated, too! :D
